        <h2>Dr. Leila Navarro — Archaeologist</h2>

        <p><strong>1) Full Name:</strong> Dr. Leila Navarro</p>
        <p><strong>2) Image:</strong> AI-generated portrait (landscape). File: <em>leila-navarro.png</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> Archaeologist — artifact recovery, site mapping, digital stratigraphy (3D documentation).</p>

        <p><strong>4) Professional Bio:</strong> Dr. Leila Navarro is an archaeologist who studies artifacts such as pottery, tools, and structural remains to understand daily life in past cultures. She earned an M.A. in Archaeology and was trained to prioritize careful documentation before collecting any object. Leila specializes in mapping excavation layers and creating clear records that keep context from being lost. She uses drones, GIS mapping, and photogrammetry to produce accurate site models. In the field, she is calm, methodical, and highly detail-oriented about labels and timestamps. She enjoys reconstructing broken ceramics because small fragments can reveal trade, diet, and routine behaviors.</p>

        <p><strong>5) Museum Role:</strong> Leads field documentation standards, trains interns, and prepares artifact records for exhibits and long-term storage.</p>

        <p><strong>6) Special Considerations:</strong> Received a small research grant for rapid 3D scanning workflows to preserve fragile artifacts before transport. She also supports bilingual field teams and emphasizes ethical “context-first” collecting.</p>

        <h2>Dr. Marcus Okoye — Physical Anthropologist</h2>

        <p><strong>1) Full Name:</strong> Dr. Marcus Okoye</p>
        <p><strong>2) Image:</strong> AI-generated portrait (landscape). File: <em>marcus-okoye.png</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> Physical Anthropologist — human remains, burial context, ethical analysis (3D osteology).</p>

        <p><strong>4) Professional Bio:</strong> Dr. Marcus Okoye is a physical anthropologist who studies human remains to learn about health, diet, injuries, and living conditions from the past. He earned a Ph.D. with a strong focus on ethics and respectful research practices. Marcus is skilled at identifying age ranges and skeletal stress markers that suggest patterns of work and lifestyle. He uses measurement tools, careful photography, and 3D scanning to protect fragile materials. His personality is thoughtful and steady, and he prefers evidence-based conclusions rather than dramatic assumptions. Marcus also works with exhibit teams to make sure displays remain accurate and respectful.</p>

        <p><strong>5) Museum Role:</strong> Oversees ethical handling protocols, manages sensitive collections, and writes scientific summaries used for exhibits and education materials.</p>

        <p><strong>6) Special Considerations:</strong> Advocates collaboration with descendant communities and supports repatriation when appropriate. He challenges the museum to be transparent about what can and cannot be proven from the evidence.</p>

        <h2>Avery Sato — Museum Interpreter</h2>

        <p><strong>1) Full Name:</strong> Avery Sato</p>
        <p><strong>2) Image:</strong> AI-generated portrait (landscape). File: <em>avery-sato.png</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Interpretive Discipline:</strong> Cultural Historian / Symbolic Analyst — cultural semiotics and decolonial museology.</p>

        <p><strong>4) Professional Bio:</strong> Avery Sato is a museum interpreter who turns research findings into stories visitors can understand. They studied cultural history and communication and enjoy connecting objects to lived experience. Avery uses cultural semiotics to explain how symbols communicate meaning across time. They also use decolonial thinking to question whose voices are centered in museum storytelling. Avery collaborates with researchers to connect excavation data with everyday life, rituals, and social structure. Their style is curious and creative, and they prefer showing multiple interpretations when evidence is incomplete.</p>

        <p><strong>5) Interpretive Method / Museum Role:</strong> Builds exhibit narratives by cross-referencing field notes, comparing symbols across cultures, and designing clear visitor-friendly labels and interactive prompts.</p>

        <p><strong>6) Special Considerations:</strong> Advocates inclusive storytelling and historically marginalized perspectives. They sometimes disagree (politely) with field researchers because Avery accepts layered meanings, while the gathering team prefers strict evidence-only conclusions.</p>
