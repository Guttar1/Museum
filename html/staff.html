        <h2>Dr. Leila Navarro — Archaeologist</h2>

        <p><strong> Full Name:</strong> Dr. Leila Navarro</p>

        <p><strong> Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> Archaeologist specializing in artifact recovery, site mapping, and digital stratigraphy.</p>

        <p><strong> Professional Bio:</strong> Dr. Leila Navarro is an archaeologist who studies artifacts such as pottery, tools, and structural remains to understand daily life in past cultures. She earned an M.A. in Archaeology and was trained to prioritize careful documentation before collecting any object. Leila specializes in mapping excavation layers and preserving context through detailed records. She uses drones, GIS mapping, and photogrammetry to create accurate site models. Her working style is calm, methodical, and highly detail-oriented. She enjoys reconstructing broken ceramics because small fragments often reveal trade, diet, and routine behavior.</p>

        <p><strong> Museum Role:</strong> Leads field documentation standards, trains interns, and prepares artifact records for exhibits and long-term storage.</p>

        <p><strong> Special Considerations:</strong> Recipient of a research grant for rapid 3D scanning workflows used to preserve fragile artifacts before transport. She also supports bilingual field teams and emphasizes ethical, context-first collection practices.</p>

        <h2>Dr. Marcus Okoye — Physical Anthropologist</h2>

        <p><strong> Full Name:</strong> Dr. Marcus Okoye</p>

        <p><strong> Subject Matter Expertise:</strong> Physical anthropologist specializing in human remains, burial context, and ethical analysis.</p>

        <p><strong> Professional Bio:</strong> Dr. Marcus Okoye is a physical anthropologist who studies human remains to learn about health, diet, injuries, and living conditions in the past. He earned a Ph.D. with a strong focus on ethical research and respectful handling practices. Marcus is skilled at identifying age ranges and skeletal stress markers that suggest patterns of work and lifestyle. He uses careful measurement, photography, and 3D scanning to protect fragile materials. His personality is thoughtful and steady, and he prefers evidence-based conclusions over dramatic assumptions.</p>

        <p><strong> Museum Role:</strong> Oversees ethical handling protocols, manages sensitive collections, and writes scientific summaries used in exhibits and educational materials.</p>

        <p><strong> Special Considerations:</strong> Strong advocate for collaboration with descendant communities and supports repatriation when appropriate. He challenges the museum to be transparent about uncertainty and evidence limits.</p>

        <h2>Avery Sato — Museum Interpreter</h2>

        <p><strong> Full Name:</strong> Avery Sato</p>

        <p><strong> Interpretive Discipline:</strong> Cultural historian and symbolic analyst focused on cultural semiotics and decolonial museology.</p>

        <p><strong> Professional Bio:</strong> Avery Sato is a museum interpreter who turns scientific findings into stories visitors can understand. They studied cultural history and communication and enjoy connecting objects to lived human experience. Avery uses symbolic analysis to explain how meaning is communicated across time and cultures. They also apply decolonial frameworks to question whose voices are represented in museum narratives. Their approach values transparency, curiosity, and multiple interpretations.</p>

        <p><strong> Interpretive Method / Museum Role:</strong> Builds exhibit narratives by cross-referencing field notes, comparing symbols across cultures, and designing visitor-friendly labels and interactive prompts.</p>

        <p><strong> Special Considerations:</strong> Advocate for inclusive storytelling and historically marginalized perspectives. Avery occasionally clashes (constructively) with field researchers by embracing layered meanings rather than single definitive conclusions.</p>
